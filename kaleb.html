              <h1 class="t1header" id="tipHeaders">Shorts are your friend</h1>
              <p class="t1desc" id="tipDescs">Seriously! Shorts are a very good thing to utilize when
                it comes to growing your channel. There are people around the world always scrolling through 
                the YouTube Shorts feed that gives a great chance of your content to be shown. Shorts also expose your channel 
                to new users which also could gain views on your non-short videos.</p>

              <h1 class="t2header" id="tipHeaders">Find your Niche</h1>
              <p class="t2desc" id="tipDescs">Doing something unique about a topic that is know to you is a great way to grow an
                audience. People will watch you for that specific topic, some make meme content and some make educational content.
                If people choose to watch you for memes and you post about Louis VIII of France you won't gain many views and 
                possibly loose subscribers.</p>

            <div class="card">
              <h1 class="t3header" id="tipHeaders">Post Consistently</h1>
              <p class="t3desc" id="tipDescs">If you post once a year, the content you post won't be pushed out as much. If you
                make an effort to post often YouTube will display your content to a wider audience. Something as simple as once a
                week shows more views.</p>

              <h1 class="t4header" id="tipHeaders">Engagement Helps</h1>
              <p class="t4desc" id="tipDescs">This is not the "will you marry me" Engagement. This is better, engagement is things
                such as Likes, Comments, Shares, Watchtime, and for shorts re-watches. All of these if positive can show YouTube
                that users are enjoying your video. Let's say you get 10,000 likes, shares and comments. This will push your video out
                to even more people, this is shown on the youtube analytical page. Now let's say the video is dead, nobody does anything
                the video won't be pushed out as much.</p>

              <p class="t5desc" id="tipDescs">Analytics on YouTube are a massive tool to use. They allow you to discover what kind of 
                videos performed well so you can learn about what made them do well. You can also experiment with different titles and 
                tags to find what goes with your video and helps it perform well.</p>
