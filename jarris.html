  <p></p>
  <br>
  <h2>1, Advertise your youtube channel.</h2>
  <p class="JNTstudios">If your Youtube channel has more exposure / more views so youtube's algorithm will show your content to more people this gives you more subscribers.</p1>
  <h2>2, You need to make GOOD CONTENT. </h2>
  <p class="JNTstudios">If you don't make good content then no one will want to watch your videos and subscribe to your channel. Make sure your content is relevant to something. Think of ideas and think before you start to create content. Keep your ideas in a doc or notes so you can add more ideas onto a doc so you won't lose them.</p1>
  <h2>3, Edit like you mean it!</h2>
  <p class="JNTstudios">It's hard to create content without editing it. If you recorded yourself doing something that's boring. Put on some music so you don't just have silence. If you don't know how to edit you can learn some good skills with some of these youtubers. </p1>

  <h2>Creativity is Key!</h2>
  <p class="JNTstudios">Making a video that no one has ever thought of is the way to get to the top of the youtube world! People like to see new stuff. Think about it for yourself, if you were watching and you just saw the same video over and over but it's just a different person making it, that's boring. When you create something new no one can tell you to do it better because YOU made it so it's your rules.</p>
  <h2>Know how to GET PEOPLE'S ATTENTION!</h2>
  <p class="JNTstudios">If you make a video and it's FIRE, how will you post the video so you will get the most people to watch it. Go look on the internet to get thumbnails. As i say “If you don't have to do the work, Don't do it!”-JNT studios. Also you need to pick a title that makes your video POP. Something you don't want to do is to make your video title something that has nothing to do with yout video. If people look up a video and yous comes up and it has nothing to do with the title the people watching will not keep watching or subscribe to your channel.</p1>
